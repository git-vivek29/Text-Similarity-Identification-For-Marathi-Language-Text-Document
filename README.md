# Text Similarity Identification For Marathi Language Text Document
### Text Similarity is one of the essential techniques of NLP which is being used to find the closeness between two chunks of text by its meaning or by surface. This project also uses various preprocessing techniques like lemmatization, sentence and word tokenization,etc. This project uses a gensim tf-idf model which takes the preprocessed Marathi language text as input and outputs a weighted tf-idf vector. This resulting vector is then used to compute the cosine similarity between the documents.

#### Inputs Details
##### The input given to the Text Similarity application will be in text format. It will be a simple text document. Input can be given via any text editor.
